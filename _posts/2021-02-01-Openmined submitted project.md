I was made aware of this community by Andrew Trask, his actually the author of a grokking series book titled [“Grokking Deep Learning”](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning). It’s one of my favorite series from Manning. He will show you how to build all the intricate part of deep learning with python from scratch. 

To have an idea what this community is about, here is a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b0CQFr6xyA&feature=emb_title) explaining their vision. Briefly, it’s about empowering us the user, by giving more tools to control our personal data we are willing to share without sacrificing our privacy. To simply put it to maximize our privacy and at the same time transparency. I was extremely skeptical about the whole idea surrounding it, but it is possible with the right infrastructure. 

As of now, there is only one course available, “Our Privacy Opportunity”. You don’t need to have any experience in any areas, there are no coding or math involved. I’ll say there is a small portion that is a little bit technical, but it is very manageable.  They will present you a lot of concepts regarding information flow between a sender and receiver, how privacy can be compromise during the process, what are the tools that can limit this leakage. They will present you five guarantees of structure transparency. At the end you will complete a project to test your knowledge, it is about 3-4 pages long. For my project, it took them around 1 to 2 weeks to correct by a real person. 

The course is new, and I have to say they have done a wonderful job. By offering all this knowledge for free, they are making a huge, huge impact for our society. These concepts can actually help our society solved a lot of issues in a lot of domains. 

Here is my [project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gP8Zq0mzh9Oz-aiWPZudGrpSwwVHXRAPh1htUpwvsI4/edit?usp=sharing) submitted and passed! Please have a look!.

As a side note, the next courses are more technical and will require knowledge of pytorch. Here is a good intro to pytorch by [Sung Kim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKq-pmkekTk&list=PLlMkM4tgfjnJ3I-dbhO9JTw7gNty6o_2m).
