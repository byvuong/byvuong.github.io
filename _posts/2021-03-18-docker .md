# Clean setup with docker for consistency

I've came across containers by following Julia Evans and Hamel Husain and wanted to try it out since 2019 or 2020 if I recall correctly. By then it wasn't possible to install docker on windows 10 home edition due to the inability of enabling Hyper-V. Now it is possible via WSL2!!

The benefits they underlined were reproducibility by porting your projects from your environment to someone else environment effortlessly. One aspect I feel hesitant when trying out a new tool is the initial setup you need to undertake and hopefully it is also easy to uninstall. Sometimes you install software over software to make a project run and suddenly you lose track what have been installed and what have been modified on your filesystem. Docker actually help you relief this stress, once you're done with the container you can delete it and start anew without tempering your system.

With Docker I tried setting up a front-end workspace to try out tailwind. Tailwind is a framework with a set of utility css class you can use right away. I see it as brushes you can use to paint your interface. It gives you large stroke to sketch your ideas quickly. I'll do a post on it once I'm done with the aws dev associate certification.

Here is the code for my dockerfile:
---

\# reference: https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/
FROM ubuntu:20.04

\# Adds metadata to the image as a key value pair example LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL maintainer="Hamel Husain <www.github.com/hamelsmu>"

\##Set environment variables
ENV LANG=C.UTF-8 LC_ALL=C.UTF-8

RUN apt-get update --fix-missing && apt-get install -y curl
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash -
RUN apt-get install nodejs -y
COPY package.json /package.json
RUN npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest


\# Open Ports for Jupyter
EXPOSE 7745

\#Setup File System
RUN mkdir ds
ENV HOME=/ds
ENV SHELL=/bin/bash
VOLUME /ds
WORKDIR /ds

CMD ["/bin/bash"]

\# docker build -t tailwinn -f ./Dockerfile ./
\# docker run -it --name containertail --net=host -v C:/Users/Bill/Documents/docker_practice/tail/:/ds tailwinn
