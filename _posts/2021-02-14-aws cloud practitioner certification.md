I recently completed the aws cloud practitioner certification, here is [my badge](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/9523c284-3646-41c7-909f-55e7c380c300).
I spent approximately 35 to 40 hours studying the material based on Exampro course. I used toggl to track my every step. 

You can view Exampro material for free on freecodecamp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE).
This video won't cover all the services offered by aws. I f you have a moment, preferably do a quick glance over the whitepapers. They are official materials offered by aws, the exam is based on these documents.

For newcomers, it’s a great introduction to the whole process for getting certified with aws. This certification will give you an overview of all the services offered by aws. I learned a lot of services that I wasn’t aware like DDOS protection, logging system and many useful tools. After completing, you should be able to pinpoint the services needed for building your online infrastructure and more importantly how to keep track of the billings. After passing, you will receive 50% off for your next certification.

The motivation for getting this certification is to get familiar with aws services for building web applications based on machine learning or deep learning. Next it would be to familiarize in building an ml system for production. I came across Chip Huyen on twitter and got more informed regarding the reality of working with machine learning. It is not only about building a model. It’s actually a small fraction of the process. There is a lot of tasks that are more closely related to software engineering.

I’m now working toward completing the aws developer certification and will be starting my project soon. 

Here is some useful reference for ml system design:
