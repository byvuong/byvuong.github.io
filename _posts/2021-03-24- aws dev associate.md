Yesterday, I finally did the exam at a test center. The overall experience was great, not a lot of people, the place was well sanitized.
Regarding the exam I used the material from Andrew Brown again. Here is the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrKRN9zRBWs. Time spent about 103 hours.

He did mention it was one of the most difficult from the associate level. I have to say if you don't have enough hands-on experience with aws it is challenging. Unfortunately, I missed by two questions and a half. The passing rate is 72%. Its more scenarios based. There is an issue, how can you solve it with the combination or order of the services. 

I went over all the whitepapers, I didn't get much from it. I wished I've spent more time with the FAQ's, I've completely forgot to go over them. It's very pertinent to get a better grasp with the ins and outs of a specific aws service, knowledge that I don't necessarily have. I've only truly used aws for about a week. My goal was to get a very very quick overview with how the aws services relate to each other and I've achieved it. I definitely recommend doing the ccp and dev associate to start your journey with cloud services. 

My next objective is to use it on a real project, I'll get more depth out of it.
